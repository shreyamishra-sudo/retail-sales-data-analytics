## Regional Performance

The West region emerges as the strongest performer, contributing the highest revenue and profit. This indicates both strong customer demand and relatively efficient cost management.
The East region also performs well, though with slightly lower profit margins compared to the West.
The Central region records high sales but significantly lower profit, which points to potential inefficiencies such as higher discounts or operational costs.
The South region generates the lowest revenue overall but maintains reasonable profitability, suggesting a smaller yet stable market presence.

These regional patterns were validated through aggregated SQL analysis and showed consistent performance trends across the dataset.

## Category Performance

Technology is the top-performing category, driving the highest revenue and profit, making it a critical contributor to overall business performance.
Office Supplies shows consistent profitability despite lower revenue than Technology, indicating stable margins and reliable demand.
Furniture stands out as an area of concern, with relatively high sales but weak profit contribution, suggesting possible issues related to discounting, logistics costs, or product returns.

Category-level profitability differences were further supported by Python-based exploratory analysis, confirming uneven margin distribution across categories.

## Discount Impact on Profitability

Orders with little to no discount are consistently profitable, while discounts above 30% are associated with negative average profit.
This suggests that aggressive discounting significantly erodes margins without delivering proportional revenue gains.
Revisiting discount strategies, especially within the 20–30% range, could help improve profitability while still supporting sales volume.

Exploratory analysis in Python reinforced this relationship, showing a clear decline in average profit as discount levels increased.

## Customer Segment Performance

The Consumer segment is the primary driver of both revenue and profit, making it the most important customer group for the business.
The Corporate segment also delivers strong returns, while the Home Office segment contributes the least in terms of revenue but remains consistently profitable.
This indicates an opportunity to grow Home Office sales in a controlled manner without substantially increasing financial risk.

Segment-wise revenue and profit contributions were consistent across both SQL aggregations and Python-based exploratory analysis.
