## Regional Performance
The West region is the strongest performer, contributing the highest revenue and profit, suggesting both strong market demand and efficient cost management.
The East region also performs well but with slightly lower margins.
The Central region shows relatively high sales but significantly lower profit, indicating potential cost or discount inefficiencies.
The South region has the lowest revenue but maintains reasonable profitability, suggesting a smaller but stable market.

## Category Performance
Technology is the most valuable category, generating both the highest revenue and profit, making it a key growth driver.
Office Supplies shows strong profitability despite lower revenue than Technology, indicating stable margins.
Furniture stands out as a concern, with high sales but disproportionately low profit, suggesting issues such as high discounts, logistics costs, or returns.

## Discount Impact on Profitability
Orders with little to no discount are consistently profitable, while discounts above 30% result in negative average profit.
This indicates that aggressive discounting erodes margins without proportional revenue benefit.
The business should review discount policies, particularly for high-volume discount bands (20–30%), to balance sales growth and profitability.

## Customer Segment Performance
The Consumer segment dominates overall revenue and profit, making it the primary contributor to business performance.
The Corporate segment also delivers strong returns, while Home Office contributes the least but remains consistently profitable.
This suggests opportunities to expand Home Office sales without significantly increasing risk.
